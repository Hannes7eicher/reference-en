[float]
=== Description
Called at the end of link:../../../../structure/sketch/loop[`loop()`] when data is available. Use `Serial.read()` to capture this data.

*Please note:* most modern boards do not support this method. See "Notes and Warnings" further below this article.

[float]
=== Syntax

[source,arduino]
----
void serialEvent() {
  //statements
}
----

The Mega 2560 R3 and Due boards have additional serial ports which can be accessed by adding the corresponding number at the end of the function.

[source,arduino]
----
void serialEvent1() {
  //statements
}

void serialEvent2() {
  //statements
}

void serialEvent3() {
  //statements
}

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
Please note that `serialEvent()` *does not work* on any modern Arduino boards. The only recognized boards to have support as of 2023/12/06 are the *UNO R3*, *Nano*, *Mega 2560 R3* and *Due*.

Instead, you can use the link:../available[`available()`] method. Examples in this page demonstrates how to read serial data only when it is available, similarly to how `Serial.event()` is implemented.
