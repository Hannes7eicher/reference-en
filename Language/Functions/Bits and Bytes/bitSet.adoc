[float]
=== Syntax
`bitSet(x, n)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`x`: the numeric variable whose bit to set. +
`n`: which bit to set, starting at 0 for the least-significant (rightmost) bit.


[float]
=== Returns
`x`: the value of the numeric variable after the bit at position `n` is set.

[float]
=== Example Code
Prints the output of `bitSet(x,n)` on two given integers. The binary representation of 4 is 0100, so when `n=1`, the second bit from the right is set to 1. After this we are left with 0110 in binary, so 6 is returned.

  int n = 1;
  Serial.print(bitSet(x, n)); // print the output of bitSet(x,n)
